      <description>Necessity is the mother of invention, but it all starts with a question. Is this the only way? What do i need that the currently available options don&amp;rsquo;t provide? How can we change this? Why? How come? Is there a better way? How can this be improved? What if? And the list of questions goes one and on.
Necessity is behind why we search for information on the internet. You could be looking for the definition of a word, a code solution on stack overflow, more information about a person or just about anything you are curious about.</description>

The Second Brain is a digital note taking system that was invented by Tiago Forte and it has multiple great benefits one of them being a solution to information overload. I was immediately intrigued just by the wording alone and i was able to find even more information by digging through YouTube and their official podcast, Building A Second Brain.</description>

      <description>2020 marked the year, when all humanity was connected and forced to change. Everyone has a story to tell as a result of it and here is mine&amp;hellip; For the first time in my life, i experienced what its like to have your plans not work out, as if that has never happened before. Maybe it was different this time or maybe it was the same as an infant learning to walk, but constantly being greeted by the gravitational pull of failure.</description>
