### Notes

The ship cover resembles the nature of the hydro mode of transportaion, automated. 


### Challenges
- Create a shell script or tasker script that automatically erases metadata for every photo captured using phones camera
1. The script would need to have access to the DCIM folder. The script would cd (change directory)
2. The script would need to initiate an application that is specifically designed to erase metadata
3. Here is the real challenge: Whats required? Overlay permission? Root permission? How do you get your script to interact with another app? Is it possible to have it automated in a way that doesnt require a GUI?
