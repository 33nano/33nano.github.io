description = "Markdown for everything and the need for documentation. Without documentation you are lost and it takes too much time to figure out things, when they could have been easily cleared, if the documentation was there. The image is just a photo edit i did of my vscodium screenshot whiel editing the rc.lua config file. I blended the screenshot with some patterns from Every Pixel and added a noise effect for a crispier look."

## Notes

Documentation is the best friend of a developer. 

Shocking realization: you dont have to memorize everything. You can always reference it. Documentation, like books are not a one time thing. They are a friend that 
you can always go back to every single time.
