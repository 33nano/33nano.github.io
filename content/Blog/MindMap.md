This mental model/ framework is attributed to Tony Buzan

Super asweom mental model even if you arent creative. The most amazing thing i discovered with this model is that it can help me summarize a book without even reading it. You need NLP for it to work. You just have to look at the table of contents only, if the TOC is vague you can quickly speed read the chapters and get an overall theme.
