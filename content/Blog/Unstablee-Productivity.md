I am a maverick when it comes to my software selection choice. I like to be on the bleeding edge of technology, i am never satisfied in being like everyone else 
that uses stable builds of an application. I like to have a taste a of the feature, bugs be damned, it wont stop me from witnessing the birth of new ideas and 
experiences that can only be lived by using unstable builds of software. The words nightly, alpha and beta trigger insurmountable excitement.
