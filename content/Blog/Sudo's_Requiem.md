Water maketh man whole, but action maketh man complete

A man is an island and a woman is a continent

Through acts of human love making a child is born

The blank slate of Tabula Rasa and an imprint period left to develop

A birth of cognitive distortions and rejuvenation of mental models

An epiphany of REBT and ascension of humanity

The limitations of proverbs and psalms, the abandonment of philosophy

The embrace of Neuroscience and reinforcing psychology

The relief of stress through exercise and gelotology

The limitations of biology enhanced by technology

Your brain is an asset more complex than astrology

Neuroscience is to the mind, what money is to plutology
