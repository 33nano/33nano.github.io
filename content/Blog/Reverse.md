A great example that i like to associate with this mental model is with the question of what do you want to do when you grow up.

I like to picture someone who answered with the response, Doctor. Why?
- Make money, the #1 response

With reverse thinking its about thinking of the end in mind. A better answer to the follow up question of why would be:
- Find a cure for X disease
- Make healthcare knowledge more accessible
-
