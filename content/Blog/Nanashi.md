Generation Z is my suffix

Born to swipe and masters of the art of remix

A generation of lifelong learners and digital nomads

Surfing the web in search of knowledge

Drowning in Dapps in search for value

Escaping reality in search of meaning

Building the next big thing, instead of dreaming

A few syllables to trigger my assistants, OK Google, Alexa and maybe Siri

Instant clicks of gratification. So much information, like what in tarnation?

Carrying labels that defy the ancient way of life

Opt out, drop out, self taught, apprenticeship and intern

Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and witnessing the birth of Quantum computing

The only generation that cares about mother nature and all of its brilliance

Self reliant travelers and collaborative content creators

Fast learners, low attention span and entertainment hoarders

Memes and emojis break linguistic or geographical borders

Rejoicing in youth and its all abundance

Hacking the present, creating the future and eliminating redundance

Nanashi means nameless and dearu koto is being

Welcome to planet Earth you nameless being
