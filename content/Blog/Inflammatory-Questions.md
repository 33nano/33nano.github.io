This is a list of burning questions that i have come to find answers to by reading various books, listening to podcasts and scouring the web. These questions arose because i felt that school only caused this post traumatic growth disorder. School only taught and continues to teach what the government wants you to know. Luckily enough, schools are not the gatekeepers of information. This post points you towards those resources, while giving a brief overview, not complete answers. I am glad that i recognized these questions early because had i not, i would have discovered them too late.
