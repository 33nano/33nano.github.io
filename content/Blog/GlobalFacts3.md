If you read something and donâ€™t apply it

You are no different than someone who is illiterate

If you watch a video and dont apply it

You are no different than someone who is blind

If you listen to a podcast  and dont apply it

You are no different than someone who is deaf

You cant consume your way to a better life, you have to create it

Consumption is passive

Creation is active
