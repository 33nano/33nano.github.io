Super awesome mental model i just learned this year by Tiago Forte.

PARA - Projects, Areas, Resources and Archive
- Projects - Specific goal with a dealine
- Areas - Continuous improvement
- Resources - Content consumpton - books, podcasts, videos
- Archive - No longer useful (deleted)

Projects have metaplan that outline the questions: who, what, when and why?
- Break big projects into smaller ones (Kaizen) and also create metaplans for those as well

The notes should be personal, not aimed at public presentation. Unpolished: messy and random
Open ended: you're always adding to your knowledge base.
Diverse mediums (images, audio, video, books, articles, code, sketches, demos...)


The Second Brain mental model is all about person knowledge management (lifelong learning).
- Browsing the library of your own mind is enormously different to the generalized documents of strangers

Another keypoint in your projects is to focus on your 12 favorite problems. A method devised by Richard Feynman (selection, research, writing, explaining and 
refining)

We believe that building a Second Brain enables us to develop our First BrainFar
 from making humans obsolete, better tools for thinking will free us to 
invest in ourselves. A Second Brain takes over the burden of remembering
 facts and details, so we are free to imagine, to create, and to enjoy 
our lives. The ultimate purpose of a Second Brain is to put our ideas to
 work for us, so we are free to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life
