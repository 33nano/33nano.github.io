# BASB (Building A Second Brain)

Super awesome mental model i just learned this year by Tiago Forte.

PARA - Projects, Areas, Resources and Archive
- Projects - Specific goal with a dealine
- Areas - Continuous improvement
- Resources - Content consumpton - books, podcasts, videos
- Archive - No longer useful (deleted)

Projects have metaplan that outline the questions: who, what, when and why?
- Break big projects into smaller ones (Kaizen) and also create metaplans for those as well

The notes should be personal, not aimed at public presentation. Unpolished: messy and random
Open ended: you're always adding to your knowledge base.
Diverse mediums (images, audio, video, books, articles, code, sketches, demos...)


The Second Brain mental model is all about person knowledge management (lifelong learning).
- Browsing the library of your own mind is enormously different to the generalized documents of strangers

Note Layers
1. Raw Notes
2. Bold passages
3. Highlights
4. Essential Summary
5. Remix into original creation

Another keypoint in your projects is to focus on your 12 favorite problems. A method devised by Richard Feynman (selection, research, writing, explaining and 
refining)

- Its about building a system of personal knowledge management that frees up attention, rather than consuming it.

We believe that building a Second Brain enables us to develop our First BrainFar
 from making humans obsolete, better tools for thinking will free us to 
invest in ourselves. A Second Brain takes over the burden of remembering
 facts and details, so we are free to imagine, to create, and to enjoy 
our lives. The ultimate purpose of a Second Brain is to put our ideas to
 work for us, so we are free to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life

By building a second brain its easier to get into a Flow state
- clear goals (you know exactly what you need to do)
- instant feedback
- good balance of challenge and skills

Dont just consume content, interact with it.

A metaplan can look something like this using various xamples
- tweets >> blog posts >> Whole book
- Figma design >> No code solution >> code it
- Creating skins for game >> No code/visual game development >> Learn code = no restrictions
-
