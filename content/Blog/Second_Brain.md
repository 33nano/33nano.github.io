Super awesome mental model i just learned this year by Tiago Forte.

<!--

We believe that building a Second Brain enables us to develop our First BrainFar
 from making humans obsolete, better tools for thinking will free us to 
invest in ourselves. A Second Brain takes over the burden of remembering
 facts and details, so we are free to imagine, to create, and to enjoy 
our lives. The ultimate purpose of a Second Brain is to put our ideas to
 work for us, so we are free to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life
