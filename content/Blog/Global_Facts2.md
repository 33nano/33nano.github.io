Life is difficult and that is a fact

Change happens one day at a time and that’s that

Life is difficult and that is a fact

We think and then we feel, that’s that

Life is difficult and that is a fact

The past is gone, the future will come, we live in the present and we must utilize it

before it becomes past

Life is difficult and that is a fact

We are all gonna die and Covid-19 reminded us of that

Life is difficult and that is a fact

Practice makes progress and there is no substitute for that

Life is difficult and that is a fact

Learning should be fun, thank TDCS,Gaming and Neuroscience for that

Life is difficult and that is a fact

Ask and learn, if you don’t know, eat healthy or it will show

Life is difficult and that is a fact

You can do anything and your Brain knows that

Life is difficult and that is a fact

Keep learning and you will never have a Brain fart
