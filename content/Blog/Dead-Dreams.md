I am sitting in a room.

Full of silence, its called a classroom

A room full of doubt and dead dreams

Screaming, why am i here?

Please let me out!

Shouting, do grades really matter?

Please let me out!

Crying, is this the only way?

Please let me out!

Sobbing, why does time move so slow?

Please let me out!

Mumbling, why does school even exist?

Please let me out!

Whispering, Is this reality?

Please let me out!

Daydreaming, its only a few years of memorization to get a paper.
