Dreams will always be dreams, nothing less and nothing more

Dreaming about sandwiches never filled anyoneâ€™s stomach

The choice to go to a restaurant or grocery store filled thy stomach

With the proper ingredients a meal was guaranteed

For the right price thyself could feed

Dreams will always be dreams, nothing more and nothing less

What exactly is a dream?

A special brainwave reading called Theta

A state associated with creativity, insight and reduced consciousness

Dreams dont come true, decisions do.

Dreams make dreams and choices make reality

The American Dream is not real, but a construct of society

Choices will get you there and dreams exist in a land called nowhere

Make the choice and it will happen

Keep dreaming and your mind will sharpen

### Poem Breakdown

In this poem, i try to define one of the most misused words out there and that word is _dream_ . In the second stanza of the poem, i start to give a very clear example using the simplest imagery that anyone can imagine. I make the distinction by pointing out that dreaming of food, or in this case a food item known as a sandwich, wont make it a reality. Dreaming of food never fills your appetite, but the action or decision to make it happen becomes a reality. In regards to the sandwich, one could order it at a restaurant or through a catering service like Uber Eats or Doordash. One could simply purchase the ingredients and make it themself because its the decision that makes it a reality not the dream. In the eighth stanza, i define a dream as a Theta brainwave which is a measurement of electrical activity that is outputted by an Electro Encephalo Gram device (EEG). The poem start out simple, but then takes a swing by adding a small Neuroscience reference. In stanzas, 10 and 11, i borrow the quote from a video i once watched by a similar title on YouTube. I am not exactly sure about the true source of the quote, as in who said it first, but i heard the quote from TK Coleman. In the 12th stanza, feel free to replaced the word _American_ , for any other nationality. The 12th stanza is simply there to state that the American dream is just made up and not a reality. I end the poem on a positive note by stating the true nature/ distinction between dreams and choices. Make the choice and it will happen, this line alone summarizes the entire poem. If you want to become something, for example a Game Developer, its the choices you make that will get you there. Immersing yourself in everything game related from paricipating in Game Jams, taking part in game related Discord servers, connecting with Twitch streamers, playing games with intent of studying and so one will bring about fruition. As opposed to someone who says they want to do something, but their actions are different like watching too much TV, binge-eating and what not. The best example by far where i find that the second to last stanza truly shines is in the event of language learning. Someone who wants to learn a language, lets say Korean, they would benefit greatly from full immersion. Changing their phone and laptop language setting to Korean, connecting with Korean people in real life and through the internet. Practicing and using Hangul everyday. Singing Korean songs, watching Korean television and so on. The person who makes the choices to fully immerse themself in the language and culture will accomplish more than just using an app like Duolingo (no offense).
