2020 has been a crazy year... <!-- but to some degree i am deeply thankful. Its odd that i would express gratitude in such a dire time, but the truth is something better happened in my life. 2020 forced me to deeply self reflect, i wish i didn't but it just happened. 2020 made me reflect on various subjects, especially on the question of, 'what do you want to do with your life?" Nothing is normal, nothing is ever going to go back to normal. Covid-19 created a new world order were those who wish to thrive, not just survive had and have to make those tough choices. Looking back at my school years, i was very active and had lots of fun in high school. A large factor of that activity is attributed to having accidentally joined choir and track & field at the same time. Without those, i would have just been like everybody else, introverted. Time skip from then, i graduated from college with a degree just to please my guardians, but the reality is and the reality i knew was that having a degree was useless. Having wasted that time, the thought of pursuing a further degree was out of the question. Wielding a degree, i realized that what i went to school is not really what i wanted to do in the first place. I had to explore, experiment and unlearn those useless things i learned in school. What am i good at? I listed down some options and coincidentally they all had to do with computers. I love creating digital art by editing photos, i love creating music and i also have some app ideas that i wish to create someday. The crossover between all those 3 elements narrowed down to an interesting topic, game development. With game development, i can combine the art that i create, the music and code to create these unique experiences.

<!-- I watchd this video with a very inspiring message it goes like this:

With money you can buy a house but not a home ,
with money you can buy a clock but not a time,
with money you can buy a bed but not a sleep,
with money you can buy food but not a appetite,
with money you can buy a doctor not a good health,
with money you can have insurance but not safety.

The problems however is that i cant the source or anything about the person who said it. -->
