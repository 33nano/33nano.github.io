2020 has been a crazy year, but to some degree i am deeply thankful. Its odd that i would express gratitude in such a dire time, but the truth is something better happened in my life. 2020 forced me to deeply self reflect, i wish i didn't but it just happened. 2020 made me reflect on various subjects, especially on the question of, 'what do you want to do with your life?" Nothing is normal, nothing is ever going to go back to normal. Covid-19 created a new world order were those who wish to thrive, not just survive had and have to make those tough choices.
