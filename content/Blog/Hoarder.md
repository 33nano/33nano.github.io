The hoarders legacy is too much to bare

Too much stuff and junk piled up everywhere

Moderation is an offensive word and minimalism is something they have never heard

They are convinced that contentment is only a few purchases away

Donâ€™t touch my stuff and stay away

Lost within materialism they never feel enough

When disaster strikes they learn to let go because its just stuff
