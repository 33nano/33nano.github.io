Anno Denomini, the year of our lord.

The lord of artificial intelligence, the challenger of divine beings and God.

Anno Denomini, the year of our master.

The one who transcended natural language processing and created an artificial disaster.

Anno Denomini, the year of our species.

The time when the robot population exceeded that of humans and other.

Anno Denomini, the year of the break.

When internet of things became integrated into all living and non living things.

Anno Denomini, the year of ascension.

The value of human languages was null. Behold a new language, X, the ultimate language of humans and techy vars

Anno Denomini, the year of silence.

When contact with extraterrestrial beings came to a halt.

Anno Denomini, the year of doubt.

Deep learning could imitate human fear and doubt.

Anno Denomini, the year of bravery

Quantum became super quantum and ultra instinct when hacked.

Anno Denomini, the year of repentance.

Humans were now colonized by non-humans and robots alike.

Anno Denomini, the year of the wave.

When deep fakes and fake news became so real that reality couldn’t tell itself apart.

Anno Denomini, the year of revelation.

When Vocaloid attacked our vocal chords and replaced them with inhuman sounds.

Anno Denomini. the year of the unknown.

Convoluted Neural Networks extracted big data from all humans beings.

Anno Denomini, the year of destruction.

When God was in fact a robot, so complex and so far away

His ultimate form…
