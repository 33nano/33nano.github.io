## Notes
- I believe the answer depends on the environment.... 
- If it takes 1 year, its because you are using MacOS or Windows, i dont see why it would take long on Linux, especially Arch or an Arch based distro
- Or just about anything that has a steep learning curve like gentoo, openBSD ...

- Thats my take, lets look at what other say, but lets analyze their words using neuro linguistic programming to get a better picture.
