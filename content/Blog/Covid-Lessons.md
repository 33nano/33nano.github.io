# Covid-19
2020 shall be recalled in history books as the year of change. Multiple things happened, many words can be assigned to the year 2020, but it all comes down to one final world, change. 2020 was supposed to be the year of vision, as a reference to visual acuity, something utilized in the medical/healthcare field. 

# Lessons
- Health is the greatest wealth
- Financial Freedom is better than financial security
- When a person is unable to change their situation, they are forced to change themselves.
- The notion of death is greater than the excuses you make and your reasons for procrastinating.
- Together everyone achieves more (team).
- Skills in tech are a must and not optional. Its not just programming.
- It’s no longer survival of the fittest, but survival of those who are able to adapt.
- Family is always there for you.
- Death can teach us everything that there is to know about living.
- We can learn a lot from others (culture and lifestyle).
- The only person who can take care of you is yourself.
- We are all humans, despite what titles or labels we get assigned (rich, celebrity, doctor)
- Entrepreneurs or problem solvers are people who charge you for a solution to a problem.
- The world doesn’t need us, but we need the world — the carbon footprint decreased by a large sum.
- Self teaching and reality are the best teachers, not college and school.
- Money is an object. It can always reappear.
- Just because its over doesn't mean you have to abandon personal hygiene (hand washing with soap and all that good stuff).
--Humanity is one race, one tongue and one nation.
- Restaurants exist, but you still need to know how to cook and feed yourself.
- When your mind is too loud from all the external noise, you can find peace through meditation.
- Pain and failure are tools that help us grow.
- Lifelong learning is the key to an active mind and opening yourself up to multiple opportunities across the world.
- Remote work is not weird.
- The best thing to do during a time of crisis is keeping a journal and self reflection.
- We can’t appreciate the new things in our lives, if we don’t appreciate what we already have (Gratitude).
