Unstoppable, private and transparent are your properties

Solidity is a drug that will free the world from the atrocities

From centralization, data monetization and inflation

Tax evaders, pros, newbies and freedom seekers are welcome

Heaven on Earth is decentralized, for the male and female

Escape the fiat and become a whale

Living in the past is no different than being in jail

Smart contracts are the future and they will prevail

Across geographical and linguistic borders, they will not fail

Those who hide behind the Metamask have found a path that is not frail

Immerse thyself in the Mainframe OS and enjoy a Steem bath

Highly scalable, immortal and hack resistant are your attributes

Satoshi Nakamoto is the new Messiah

Blockchain sounds like a word that is meant to bind us, but yet it frees us

Its more than just a form of payment and complex is its nature

A system based on cryptographic proof, devoid of trust

Everything the system touches becomes decentralized

Visa and mastercard will become relics of the past
