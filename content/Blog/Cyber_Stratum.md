We kill trees but our storage is digital

The topic of our tropical planet is hysterical

Man made machines and machines make man money

When the sea level and temperature is rising, ain’t that funny or is it surprising?

This is the raid, charade, masquerade and parade of the greenhouse gases

Millennial’s shall suffer if we don’t fight these old timers and old dumb asses

The old timers near death, why would they care?

The current and new generation will not suffer, but truly despair.

Escape to space and suffer the same fate, humans are a despicable race
