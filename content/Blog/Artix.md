# Why?

 Not long ago, my knowledge of operating systems was limited. I only thought that Windows and MacOS were the only operating systems in existence, little did i know
there was another universe waiting for me. A universe filled with freedom, safer and more secure, extremely customizable, faster and filled with an even larger community
than my brain could ever comprehend. I remember the feeling of accomplishment i felt the first time i ever installed a linux distribution on my personal computer. I was
super happy, i could find leave the world of claustrophia inducing windows and genetically modified apples, for a penguin? I was finally breathing the same air as the Xenial
Xerus (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS). From that point onwards, i would participate in the act of distro hopping (switching from and across linux distributions). I experienced just about 
every linux distribution listed in the top 30 of the distrowatch ranking. I tasted various desktop environment flavors in search of something more tastier, but i didnt exactly know
what i wanted. I encountered a wide variety of issues along the way, but the answers were only a simple search away. I was never truly satisfied with the distros i utilized.
They all came preinstalled and preconfigured with loads of packages. I wondered to myself, "is there a linux distirbution out there thats minimal?" One question led to another and 
eventually i was reading about arch linux. 

### Work in progress (Notes)

- systemd?
- Artix linux?
- Why not give it a try, if i dont like it, i'll just go back to manjaro
