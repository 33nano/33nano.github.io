# Why?

 Not long ago, my knowledge of operating systems was limited. I only thought that Windows and MacOS were the only operating systems in existence, little did i know
there was another universe waiting for me. A universe packed with freedom,better security, extremely customizable, faster and filled with an even larger community,
than my brain could ever comprehend. I remember the feeling of accomplishment i felt the first time i ever installed a linux distribution on my personal computer. I was
super happy, i could finally leave the world of claustrophobia inducing windows and genetically modified apples, for a penguin? I was finally breathing the same air as the Xenial
Xerus (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS). From that point onwards, i would participate in the act of distro hopping (switching from and across linux distributions). I experienced just about 
every linux distribution listed in the top 30 of the [distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/) ranking at that time. I tasted various desktop environment flavors in search of something more tastier, but i didnt exactly know
what i wanted. I encountered a wide variety of issues along the way, but the answers were only a simple search away. I was never truly satisfied with the distros i utilized.
They all came preinstalled and preconfigured with loads of packages. I wondered to myself, "is there a linux distirbution out there that's minimal?" One question led to another and 
eventually i was reading about Arch linux. Arch linux was the answer that i had been looking for all this time, but the installation process was daunting. I feared that things could go wrong during the installation rendering my computer useless and forced to buy a new computer. I never tried it, but the Arch linux principle of simplicity stuck with me. The Arch Linux wiki defines simplicity as _without unnecessary additions and modifications_ .

### Work in progress (Notes)

- systemd?
- Artix linux?
- Why not give it a try, if i dont like it, i'll just go back to manjaro
