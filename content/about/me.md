Welcome to my blog. My name is Prince Kaizen Namwali, an Afropolitan from the warm heart of Africa. My go to tagline on the web is _Lifelong Learner, Digital Nomad & Game Developer._ I love writing about all sorts of things from poetry, things that I'm learning about, game development and more. The secret ingredient to my writing is Neuro-Linguistic Programming (it's a brain changer).
