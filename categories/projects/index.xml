      <description>I started the year 2021 with a bang. I learned about this awesome personal knowledge management system called a Second Brain. The Second Brain is a digital note taking system that was invented by Tiago Forte and it has multiple great benefits, one of them being a solution to information overload. I was immediately intrigued just by the wording alone and i was able to find even more information by digging through YouTube and their official podcast, Building A Second Brain.</description>
