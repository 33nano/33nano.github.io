      <description>Why? Not long ago, my knowledge of operating systems was limited. I only thought that Windows and MacOS were the only operating systems in existence,but little did i know that there was another universe out there.

I remember the feeling of excitement that ran across my face, when i first installed a linux distribution on my personal computer.</description>
