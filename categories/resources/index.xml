      <description>Necessity is the mother of invention, but it all starts with a question. Is this the only way? What do i need that the currently available options don&amp;rsquo;t provide? How can we change this? Why? How come? Is there a better way? How can this be improved? What if? And the list of questions goes one and on.
Necessity is behind why we search for information on the internet. You could be looking for the definition of a word, a code solution on stack overflow, more information about a person or just about anything you are curious about.</description>
