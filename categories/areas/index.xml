      <description>The motto for Urban Dictionary is &amp;ldquo;Define Your World&amp;rdquo;, but thats probably offensive to Etymologists. Language is a living and breathing thing, its only natural that words change meaning over time, evolve or eventullay become rarely usable (historic). I find myself fascinated by words, not at the level of a etymologist or a sapiosexual, but at the polyglot level, i probably just made that up. I claim to have a deeper understanding of some words which i have interpretated using some twisted logic and this is a list of those words.</description>
