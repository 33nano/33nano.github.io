  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p><em>Mater artium necessitas</em> is a quote by Plato that was translated by a theologian by the name Benjamin Jowett, which means <em>necessity is the mother of invention</em> Throughout my encounter with this english proverb I have found that almost all instances of it have one thing in common. I would humbly extend the quote by saying <em>necessity is the mother of invention, but it all starts with a question</em> . Necessity is the behind the reason that has led to all the human inventions recorded throughout history and the ongoing innovation that take place today. Necessity is driven by a multitude of questions whose desire is not simply to find answers, but put in practice to give birth to practical solutions. The following are just a handful of questions that can drive necessity: Is this the only way? How can we change this? Why? How come? Is there a better way? How can this be improved? What if?</p>
<p>Necessity is behind why we search for information on the internet. You could be looking for the definition of a word, a code solution on Stack Overflow, more information about a person or just about anything you are curious about. Necessity can be driven by curiosity, frustration, longing for something better, a new and improved solution or a remix of something exisiting. As a lifelong learner, I am exposed to wide array of inventions that have captured my attention. Listed below are those inventions that have not only captured the vision of my optic nerves, but also the electrical activity of my brain, blood circulation of my heart and aura circulation of my soul.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can be your own credential</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>College is dead, but most people just dont know it yet (Isaac Morehouse). Praxis is not just another third party credential or just another college alternative, its a program unlike any other that empowers people to become their own credential. Praxis instills the beauty of a permissionless mindset and the essence of value creation which is the key to unlocking opportunities. What needs led to the birth of Praxis? What questions drove them to find answers? The answer to those questions lies in their analysis of the current system of education, more specifically college. In their words: College is a business that sells the idea that you need them in order to be successful. If you give up 4 years of your life and pay them loads of money - you&rsquo;ll be guaranteed a good job, make lots of money, social acceptance and personal happiness. The problem however is that they are not very good at delivering that promise. The team at Praxis saw that the current system is broken or has been broken for a long time. The longing for something better, longing for something that can guarantee results, the longing for an individual to boldly pursue what makes them come alive, without the fear of owing lenders large sums of money, the fear of ending up in dead end career and the fear of the disapproval of friends and family was what drove them to create Praxis. Necessity is the mother of invention, but it all starts with a question. I like to think that the questions asked went something like this: What do college opt outs and college drop outs have in common? Is college the only way? What killed college? Why do parents insist that their children go to college, when even they havent benefited? What exactly is a college degree? How can people create a better signal? What do companies really care about? Thats just a speculative list of questions, but surely enough they had to find solutions to those questions. I believe the mission and the company Praxis should be known worldwide.</li>

<li>The Crash platform was born at Praxis, the first example that i just covered right above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è. Necessity is the mother of invention, but it all starts with a question. What sort of questions led to the birth of Crash? The team at Crash saw yet another problem, not just in the education system, but also the career seeking side. Resumes or curriculum vitaes are these static pieces of paper that contain a small snippet about you. A resume is supposed to list your work experience, references, skills and other relevant information about you under strictly confined formatting. The process of joh hunting/job campaign involves filling out HTML forms strictly formatted with boolean option responses, input fields, multiple choice questions, proving your humanity through Captcha, selling your personal information and submitting a piece of paper that signifies you. No matter how long or how many times it takes to complete a single form, these bland pieces of paper are later filtered out by these non humanoid beings called applicant tracking systems (ATS) that search for keywords that pertain to skills, gender, race, name structure, higher learning credentials, immigrant status and who knows what&hellip; Maybe then the ATS sends that application to be reviewed by some sort of real human personell in charge of hiring or by self righteus autonomous authority and intelligence does it get to decide who moves on to the next step of the hiring process, the interview. Those filtered out by the system are later sent an automated response that contains the same structure replicated across various companies contaiining the key words: unfortunately, another candidate&hellip;</li>

The longing for something better than the current web was what fueled the fruition of this project. The team behind IPFS realized that the internet is fundamentally broken, so they asked, how can we make it better? In order to make it better or fix it in this case, they had to look at the flaws of the internet. They had to look at what the original purpose of the internet was and what it had become. The internet as we know it today is inefficient, expensive, centralized and it simply cant preserve the history of humanity. The birth of IPFS was to make the web more efficient, inexpensive, decentralized</li>

<li><strong>Is it possible to make a music video using a game engine?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yes! One of the best examples is the music video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrDcTGvp7o">Rainfall</a> by Stormzy and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8v9z28PYY">video</a> goes behind the scenes. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and it got me thinking just how awesome the idea of using a game engine to make music videos would be. In the music video Stormzy barely moves and most of the visual effects happen in the background with a glitch transition that changes the scenery. Music video dont require high p Game engines are primarily used for creating games, but when I look around I see a multitude of possibilites from the plugins developers create to extend the functionality of a game engine. I believe the process would go something like this: creating artwork using a 3D tool like <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, mapping the motion capture using something like <a href="https://chordata.cc/">Chordata</a> and then putting it altogether using a custom made plugin built on a game engine like <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> (GDScript)</li>

<li><strong>How can i automate the process  of clearing metadata from my Android phone without having to do it manually?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Clearing metadata from photos is possible with the various applications that are available on the Play Store and F-Droid, but it doesnt happen automatically. The process requires you to open the application, grant it access to the location that contains the images and then choosing another destination for the files to be saved. This process can take anywhere from a few second to a minute depending on the amount of photos that the user wants to erase metadata from. The good news or truth is that this process can be automated. In order to make this a possibility we would need to create a separate application or custom script. The app or script would need to have access to the DCIM folder, which is where photos captured by the phone camera are stored. If it was an application all you need is for the app to run in the background and the only permission required would be the storage. However, to save even more time, a script would be a more fitting solution and could even be intergrated into a custom Android ROM. However, the challenge with scripting on android is that its more beneficial for power users or users with a rooted system (Magisk or Super SU). As far as scripting goes the most famous solution is the application tasker. The script would need to have access to the DCIM folder clear the metadata. With termux its possible, but script automation through using Tasker and termux is a challenge. It would be better if the script automatically ran when new images populate in the DCIM folder, as opposed to manuallly running the script in order to automate the process. The road to clearing metadata from files, not just images is a challenge.</li>

<ul>
<li>Being a game developer is one of those revered careers, but when i began to ponder i couldn&rsquo;t find any reason why a person would become a game developer. Anyone can make a video game with out without code, heck the easist type of game to make is a visual novel and its basically the same as a powerpoint. Alright you spent a year or more to create your first ever indie game, but have you solved? If people keep using the same approach to making video games, i dont think&hellip; Observe the masses and do the opposite, but everyone wants to do the same thing as the massess. I believe the beauty of gamification is being wasted on creating addictive mobile games/ video games that contain no value. I believe using gamification as a means for things like Neuroscience, learning and real world problems is a step in the right path, but how many people are doing it?</li>

<li><strong>Is it possible to keep up with TV content without watching TV?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>TV is a waste of time, but it almost seems like in order to remain a high functioning sociable member of society you must pledge your alliance to some show or medium that presents itself on TV. One of the programs people love to exchange their precious time for is TV shows, whether is its animated or portays real human beings. When i first had this question, i was aware of a service by the name <a href="https://www.vidangel.com/">VidaAngel</a>, a service that enables consumers the ability to filter out scenes which you wish not to see in movies or any TV show. My astonishment with using Vidangel allowed me to question, what if? What if you could skip watching TV altogether and still be in the so called zone of awareness? This would save you precious time and the detrimental effects of blue light devouring your optic nerves. The bigger challenge is answering the how? Isnt human intervention ncessary? What are the odds of summaries being biased?&hellip;</li>

<li><strong>What would a virtual fitting room look like?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The good thing about shopping offline at a clothing store is that the consumer has the added advantage of a physical fitting room. In a fitting room the consumer can directly found out the appropriate clothing size and also the clothing appearance. With a physical fitting room you dont need to visualize the appearance of the clothing in your hand because you can make it a reality and decide whether or not your choice actually suites you. The disadvantage of shopping for clothes online is that there is a limit to ones visualization. Just because you think you would look cool wearing those clothes doenst gracefully translate in reality. Visualization is a problem and the need is a clear indicator, a mirror of sorts. This is were i propose a cool idea of a virtual fitting room. With the advancements in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (XR), i believe its possible. Imagine for a second, creating a 3D model of yourself, think of it as your <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, but optimized for shopping. This 3D Gravatar would function as your mirror, instead of the relying on the imperfect mirror of visualization. If the clothes are too big or too small the changes you see would be a direct reflection of that&hellip;.</li>
