The Second Brain is a digital note taking system that was invented by Tiago Forte and it has multiple great benefits, one of them being a solution to information overload. I was immediately intrigued just by the wording alone and i was able to find even more information by digging through YouTube and their official podcast, Building A Second Brain.","tags":["Projects"],"title":"New Year: Second Brain ðŸ§ ","url":"https://33nano.xyz/blog/2021-reboot/"},{"categories":["Archive"],"description":"2020 marked the year, when all humanity was connected and forced to change. Everyone has a story to tell as a result of it and here is mine\u0026hellip; For the first time in my life, i experienced what its like to have your plans not work out, as if that has never happened before. Maybe it was different this time or maybe it was the same as an infant learning to walk, but constantly being greeted by the gravitational pull of failure.","tags":["Archive"],"title":"Sayonara 2020 ðŸ’”","url":"https://33nano.xyz/blog/2020/"}]
